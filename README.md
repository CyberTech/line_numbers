Line numbers Redmine plugin
===========================

Redmine plugin that enables line numbering in code blocks and adds a toggle button to turn it on/off.

- Installation: just clone it to your plugins directory. No other steps needed.
- Compatibility: tested with Redmine 2.3, but I assume it works with older versions as well
